# GitHub Setup Guide for Beginners

Welcome! Here's your step-by-step guide to connect to GitHub for the first time.

## ✅ Step 1: Install Xcode Command Line Tools (Currently In Progress)
You've just started the installation. A pop-up window should have appeared asking you to install the tools. Please click "Install" and wait for it to complete (this may take 10-15 minutes).

## Step 2: Create a GitHub Account
If you haven't already, go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create a free account.

## Step 3: Configure Git on Your Computer
Once the Xcode tools installation is complete, we'll configure Git with your name and email:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

**Important:** Use the SAME email address you use for your GitHub account!

## Step 4: Choose Your Authentication Method
You have two options to connect to GitHub:

### Option A: HTTPS with Personal Access Token (Easier for Beginners)
1. Generate a Personal Access Token on GitHub:
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a name like "My Computer"
   - Select scopes: check `repo` (all boxes under it)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)

2. Use the token when pushing (Git will prompt you for it)

### Option B: SSH (More Secure, Better Long-Term)
Generate an SSH key and add it to GitHub:
1. Generate SSH key
2. Add to GitHub
3. Test the connection

## Step 5: Initialize Your Repository
For this project, you'll need to:
1. Initialize a Git repository: `git init`
2. Add files: `git add .`
3. Commit: `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
4. Connect to GitHub: `git remote add origin <your-repo-url>`
5. Push: `git push -u origin main` (or `master`)

## Step 6: Create a Repository on GitHub
1. Go to github.com
2. Click the "+" icon → "New repository"
3. Name it (e.g., "hello-world")
4. DON'T initialize with README (since you already have files)
5. Click "Create repository"
6. Copy the repository URL
